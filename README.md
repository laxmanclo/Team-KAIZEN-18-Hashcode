# Image Recognition Assistant for Dementia Patients

This project aims to create an image recognition assistant tailored for individuals with dementia or memory-related issues. The assistant allows users to upload images, which are then processed by ChatGPT to extract and store textual information. Users can then search for images using keywords associated with the image content.

## How it Works

1. **Upload Images**: Users can upload images to the application interface.

2. **Image Processing**: The uploaded images are processed by ChatGPT, which analyzes the content and extracts relevant textual information.

3. **Text Storage**: The extracted text from the images is stored in a database, associating each piece of text with the corresponding image.

4. **Search Functionality**: Users can input keywords or phrases related to the content of the images they want to recall.

5. **Image Retrieval**: The application retrieves images associated with the provided keywords from the database and displays them to the user.

## Features

- **Image Recognition**: Utilizes ChatGPT to analyze images and extract textual information.
- **Textual Storage**: Stores extracted text from images for easy retrieval.
